    <h3>Fibroid</h3>
    <b><p>What is a fibroid? Fibroids are tumors made of smooth muscle
       cells and fibrous connective tissue that develop in the uterus.
        It is estimated that 70 to 80 percent of women will develop fibroids
        in their lifetime — however, not everyone will develop symptoms or require treatment.
        Fibroids range in size from seedlings, undetectable by the human eye, to bulky masses 
        that can distort and enlarge the uterus. You can have a single fibroid or multiple ones. 
        In extreme cases, multiple fibroids can expand the uterus so much that it reaches the rib
         cage and can add weight.Many women have uterine fibroids sometime during their lives. 
         But you might not know you have uterine fibroids because they often cause no symptoms. 
         Your doctor may discover fibroids incidentally during a pelvic exam or prenatal ultrasound.

        <h3>Urinary tract Infections</h3>
        <b><p>Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are most often caused by bacteria (germs)
             that get into the bladder, which is part of the urinary tract. UTIs are
             also called bladder infections. UTIs are common, especially in women.
             More than half of women will have at least one UTI at some point in 
             life.1 UTIs are serious and often painful. But most UTIs are easy to treat with antibiotics.

        <h3>Cervical Cancer</h3>
        <b><p>Cervical cancer is a type of cancer that occurs in the cells of the 
            cervix — the lower part of the uterus that connects to the vagina.
             Various strains of the human papillomavirus (HPV), a sexually
             transmitted infection, play a role in causing most cervical cancer.
            When exposed to HPV, the body's immune system typically prevents
             the virus from doing harm. In a small percentage of people, however, 
             the virus survives for years, contributing to the process that causes
              some cervical cells to become cancer cells.

        <h3>Menstrual Hygiene</h3>
        <b><p>With billions of people, it’s surprising and disappointing that only a small percentage
            of women in India have access to clean hygiene when it comes to menstrual care. Culturally,
            a large percent of the population still associates the menstrual cycle with uncleanliness
            and women are often prohibited from going to religious places or even preparing food when 
            on their period. It is usually a taboo topic, which makes it even more difficult for young
            girls and women to break out of the vicious cycle of misconceptions. Even today, millions 
            of women in India do not have access or cannot afford to buy sanitary pads because of their
            cost, relying on unhygienic methods such as cloth, leaves or husks. This can result
            in infections, rashes, and discomfort.
